* One org file as one book

New book is composed as one org file, using [[https://zenn.dev/conao3/articles/ox-zenn-usage][ox-zenn]]. Here is the export function:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun org-zenn-export-buffer-to-book (&optional org-dir)
    "Runs subtree export to each level 1 headings. Respects `#+BOOK_DIR'."
    (interactive)
    (let* ((dir default-directory)
           (pub-dir (car (cdr (car (org-collect-keywords '("BOOK_DIR" "XYZ")))))))
        ;; cd into the target directory, but manually:
        (when pub-dir (cd pub-dir))
        ;; export all the top level headings and come back:
        (unwind-protect
                (org-map-entries (lambda () (org-zenn-export-to-markdown nil t)) "LEVEL=1")
            (when pub-dir (cd dir)))))
#+END_SRC
